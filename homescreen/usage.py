"""Screen Time usage from this Mac, and page-swipe estimates.

With Screen Time's "Share Across Devices" on, macOS keeps the iPhone's app-focus history in
Biome: ~/Library/Biome/streams/restricted/App.InFocus/remote/<device>/<file>. Files are SEGB
logs named by their start time (microseconds since 2001-01-01); each record holds the bundle id
of the app in focus. Reading them needs Full Disk Access for the app running this code.

We don't decode the records fully. Each app session shows up as a pair of records (start, end)
carrying its bundle id, so counting bundle-id occurrences per file and halving gives "opens".
That's an estimate, good for ranking apps, which is all the optimizer needs.
