# Rebuilding Screen Organizer

The combined Python engine is distributed under GPL version 3 or later. The original Homescreen source and its MIT copyright notice are in `project/LICENSE`. Each upstream component keeps its own license.

Use the source archive from the same release as your app or MCPB. Verify the archive against that release’s `SHA256SUMS.txt`, then extract it into a new directory. The commands below run from that directory with a Python 3.12 bootstrap interpreter. `MANIFEST.json` identifies the release commit, the native ZIP hashes and the original source archives. `inventories/arm64.json` and `inventories/x86_64.json` map the frozen modules, native files and notices to those inputs.

## Edit a library

Use a native Mac of the target architecture, macOS 14 or later, the Xcode Command Line Tools and Python 3.12. Intel builds of cryptography also require Perl, Rust 1.95.0 and the matching Intel OpenSSL build. The source helper checks each selected input before opening it.

```sh
ARCH=$(uname -m)
python3.12 project/macapp/rebuild_sources.py component pylzss --arch "$ARCH" --output editable-pylzss
```

Edit `editable-pylzss/src/pylzss.c`. To build a matching native extension, use the release interpreter, install the locked build tools, and build a wheel from the edited source directory.

```sh
export HOMESCREEN_SOURCE_CACHE="$PWD/sources"
mkdir -p release-tools local-wheels
python3.12 project/macapp/native_sources.py --arch "$ARCH" --destination "$PWD/release-tools/python"
release-tools/python/bin/python3.12 -m venv release-tools/venv
PYTHON="$PWD/release-tools/venv/bin/python"
LOCK="$PWD/project/requirements-build.lock"
if [ "$ARCH" = x86_64 ]; then
  bash project/macapp/prepare_intel.sh "$PYTHON" "$PWD/project/build/dependencies/x86_64"
  LOCK="$PWD/project/build/dependencies/x86_64/requirements-build.lock"
  "$PYTHON" -m pip install --require-hashes --only-binary=:all: --find-links "$PWD/project/build/dependencies/x86_64/wheels" -r "$LOCK"
else
  "$PYTHON" -m pip install --require-hashes --only-binary=:all: -r "$LOCK"
fi
"$PYTHON" project/macapp/rebuild_sources.py wheel --arch "$ARCH" --source editable-pylzss --wheelhouse local-wheels --output local-requirements.lock
"$PYTHON" -m pip install --no-deps --force-reinstall local-wheels/pylzss-*.whl
"$PYTHON" -c 'import lzss; assert lzss.decompress(lzss.compress(b"Hello")) == b"Hello"'
```

The generated `local-requirements.lock` records the hash of your edited wheel. Install it into a fresh virtual environment with `pip install --require-hashes --only-binary=:all: --find-links local-wheels -r local-requirements.lock`. On Intel also pass the directory containing the prepared cryptography wheel. Use this environment to run the editable project, its command line tools and the PyInstaller and Swift build steps described in `project/macapp/BUILDING.md`.

## Refreeze a modified Python package

For a pure-Python component such as h11, run the `component` command with `h11`, edit its Python source, then run the same `wheel` command with that editable directory. Refreeze the engine and Swift app using the resulting local lock.

```sh
"$PYTHON" project/macapp/rebuild_sources.py refreeze --arch "$ARCH" --wheelhouse local-wheels --lock local-requirements.lock --output "$PWD/modified-build"
"$PYTHON" project/macapp/check_mcp.py -- "$PWD/modified-build/Screen Organizer.app/Contents/Resources/engine/engine" mcp
```

The local build creates a signed app in the selected directory. Its `Contents/Resources/LOCAL-BUILD.json` records the original and replacement wheel hashes, the frozen engine digest and the hashes of changed editable files. An official release uses the clean Git export and the upstream wheel hashes. For a development build of an edited source tree, use the local refreeze route.

## Install a replacement into your own app

Copy the installed macOS app into your build directory. Replace the shared extension and ad-hoc sign that copy.

```sh
ditto "/Applications/Screen Organizer.app" "$PWD/Screen Organizer.app"
LIB=$("$PYTHON" -c 'import lzss; print(lzss.__file__)')
cp "$LIB" "$PWD/Screen Organizer.app/Contents/Resources/engine/_internal/"
codesign --force --deep --sign - "$PWD/Screen Organizer.app"
codesign --verify --deep --strict "$PWD/Screen Organizer.app"
"$PYTHON" project/macapp/check_mcp.py -- "$PWD/Screen Organizer.app/Contents/Resources/engine/engine" mcp
```

For the unpacked MCPB, replace the same library in `server/$ARCH/_internal/` and sign the replacement extension using `codesign --force --sign -`. The engine runs as a separate process. The launcher uses the selected architecture and its ordinary stdio entry point.

## Rebuild native inputs

Use `MANIFEST.json` to locate upstream archives by their input names. The source archive names retain their SHA-256 prefixes. To reuse embedded source downloads, set `HOMESCREEN_SOURCE_CACHE="$PWD/sources"` before invoking the build helpers. `project/macapp/sources/native.json` names the provider, native recipes, source archives and Cargo requirements for each owning component.

- CPython comes from the recorded python-build-standalone release. `pbs/recipe` contains its patches, configure/build scripts and download definitions. The two `provider-full-metadata` archives contain the original `python/PYTHON.json` target/build details. The `pbs-sources/` inputs include CPython and its statically linked libraries. Build the provider's recorded PGO and LTO target using its Darwin build scripts. The prebuilt, verified interpreter used by the release is also included.
- Pillow’s `pillow/recipe` contains its macOS wheel workflow, dependency-version file and native build patches. Use the included `pillow/multibuild` checkout and the `pillow-mirror/` dependency archives named by the recipe. The `avif/` archives supply the selected nested AOM, dav1d, libyuv and SharpYUV sources. Use the selected Darwin feature flags from the wheel recipe.
- For Rust libraries, extract the owner's Python source and run `python3.12 project/macapp/rebuild_sources.py cargo-vendor --output "$PWD/cargo-vendor" > cargo-config.toml`. Install that file as `.cargo/config.toml` in the editable workspace. Run the owner’s original maturin or Cargo recipe in locked offline mode. The registry archives and checksum data come from the original workspaces’ Cargo locks. The `wheel-recipe/` inputs contain upstream generation and wheel workflows.
- For Intel cryptography, follow `project/macapp/prepare_intel.sh` with the recorded OpenSSL source and static configure/link flags. For other native extensions follow the component's `pyproject.toml`, C/Cython build scripts and wheel recipe. The `overlays/` directories retain generated or changed editable package files from each actual wheel. Each path is relative to its installed owner.

The Swift shell and the macOS integration sources are in `project/macapp/Shell/`. Build the app on the corresponding native architecture using `project/macapp/build.sh`. macOS frameworks and ordinary development tools are supplied by the system and its toolchain.
